Failing to get a positive response from her, he forcibly undressed her.  Apprehensive about rousing the attention of the household who did not know of his presence inside her room, she resisted him with minimal strength, but she was really sobbing in a muffled manner. He then undressed himself while blocking the door. Yet, the image of a hapless and sobbing Amethyst soon brought him to his senses, and impelled him to leave her room naked.  He did not notice in his hurry that Amante, the father of Amethyst, who was then sitting alone on a sofa in the sala, saw him leave his daughter’s room naked.\n\nOutside the house, the now-clothed Aliswan spotted Allesso, Amethyst’s former suitor. Knowing how  Allesso  had  aggressively pursued Amethyst, Aliswan fatally  stabbed Allesso.    Aliswan immediately went into hiding afterwards.\n\nUpon learning from Amethyst about what Aliswan had done to her, an enraged Amante wanted to teach Aliswan a lesson he would never forget.
